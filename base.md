The primary purpose of this document is to ease the interaction of my colleagues with me and provide them with a better understanding of how I work. As I'm evolving in my career path some points will be changed. The idea for this document came from Claire Hughes Johnson's [book](https://press.stripe.com/scaling-people) and Barbara Bermes's [OS](https://github.com/bbinto/working-with-bb/tree/main) with whom I share lots of respect.

## My role

My current role is a Delivery Manager, where I follow the work of our teams to unblock their operations where needed, improve their systems, and help them create more value around their products.

## About me

I consider myself a pretty approachable, open person, who always values some good laugh. Though sometimes I may seem arrogant, I can sincerely admit my mistake and apologise. I highly appreciate working with smart, hardworking, neat, and initiative people.

## Operating approach

### Metrics

I believe that any management is found on metrics. That's why my operational processes involve careful observations of various metrics. I like to spend some time every day to review the state of the systems we use, making sure they're in good order and reflect the up-to-date state of reality.

Note that there's an important difference between input and output metrics. Both should be monitored, however, you can only really influence the former. The key is to find what inputs affect the outputs and in what way.

### Feedback loops

Simply put, every day as professionals we do some stuff and see whether it works out. To grow we need good-quality feedback. The faster we receive it and act on it, the faster we can grow.

For internal feedback loops, I will always leave some time to reflect on a situation or experience myself. Jotting down the thoughts will significantly boost this process. Sometimes it's beneficial to compare and share the impressions of several people.

### Artefacts

Leave more artefacts after yourself. Shared documents, templates, schemas, and mind maps add substantially to the alignment of people. Please, keep them nicely formatted and organised. People should find them easily and enjoy the interaction all over the way.

## Management style

- **Dive Deep**. I'm not afraid of joining the operational teams and doing some tasks. Hands-on experience from time to time allows you to see a clearer picture of how processes work from the inside and drive better conclusions.
- **Value-oriented**. The things you're doing should add to the value of our products. Share them, and ask for external review and feedback. I will actively cut the non-value-adding work from the agenda (this doesn't relate to recovery time and socialisation).
- **Learn by doing**. I will gradually increase the level of your impact on certain processes to help you grow. Don't get overwhelmed by the amount of new things to learn, proceed in iterations. Generate hypotheses, test/break them, and improve upon them. Yes, you're allowed to fail.
- **Facts based**. Let's center our discussions around the information we're sure about. Not rumours or suspicions. If anyone needs more time to collect it, we will take that time. 
- **Operational excellence**. Great products come with great service. We invest a lot of effort in observability and maintenance. Our stakeholders always receive timely and transparent updates.
- **Ownership**. There will be things owned by you. In this regard, to own something is to demonstrate end-to-end responsibility for the result. If something didn't work out as expected show your best efforts.

## Communication

Nothing beats person-in-person communication. Though, it's not always feasible. Verbal communication and shared sessions are super helpful in my opinion for tackling/discussing problems. And sometimes it's just pleasant to chat with colleagues synchronously on a call/huddle.

Day to day, regular questions are better raised in public channels to share the context. Important stuff goes to the special FYI channel.

I'm more than happy to help you tackle some challenges you're facing or share my thoughts, but please do some initial research on your own before approaching. Don't get offended by long response times in chats, if the matter needs timely resolution - explicitly highlight it in the message.

Keep the communication concise and to the point. Save the mental effort for your recipient.

### Weekly 1 on 1 meetings

The 1-on-1s are usually held every week and follow a template to log our progress working together. We're going to use a simple template to go through your goals, personal development, problems, notes/news, and feedback. Please, fill them out in advance.

### Weekly managers' meetings

We use this time to align internally with our managers. Plan shared projects and decide on common challenges.

### Weekly newsletters

Help quickly recap on what was going on and share broader context among teams. Depending on the situation may be substituted for or mixed with live Q&A sessions.
